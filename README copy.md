# OMNI-CORE: Citizen Operations & Intelligence Network

> "Take the helm. Own your success."

OmniCore is a Star Citizen companion hub — a PWA combining ship intelligence, peripheral configuration, and in-game tooling in one MobiGlass-inspired interface.

---

## Vision & Motivation

OmniCore was born from a simple observation: while Cloud Imperium Games has built an impressive scope of tools for Star Citizen, there's always room for innovation in how we play.

As a backer since 2013, I've watched the game evolve and wanted to be ready when Squadron 42 launches. After taking a break and returning to master flying mechanics, I found the HOTAS configuration process tedious. Most games struggle with this. Rather than accept the limitations, I built a tool to edit the game's XML configuration files directly, backup configurations to GitHub or Google Drive, and manage profiles effortlessly.

From there, the vision expanded: **What if OmniCore could become an operating system for how I play Star Citizen?**

### Where We're Heading

- **Fleet Management**: Track your hangar, manage loadouts per ship, visualize your collection
- **Career Tracking**: Monitor playtime, contract history, and progression across your account
- **Advanced HOTAS**: Full support for multi-mode controllers (like the Logitech/Saitek X52's 3-position switch)
  - Pre-built mode profiles (e.g., "Landing & Navigation", "Combat", "Mining")
  - Seamless XML sync with backups
  - Profile version control
- **Modular Design**: Extensible for future in-game data, Spectrum integration, and beyond
- **Mobile-First**: PWA today, native Android app tomorrow

We've moved beyond prototype — OmniCore is a working companion hub with real utility for players preparing for Squadron 42 and beyond.

## For Players

### What's Inside

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **GT05 Ship Database** | Full ship roster with filters, sortable columns, expandable specs, and dossier modal with official video |
| **HC05 Technology Config** | Load your Star Citizen XML profile, visualize HOTAS/KBM bindings, right-click to reassign inputs, and export back to XML |
| **VerseMail** | Submit contact transmissions or bug reports directly from the app (email + GitHub issue) |
| **AeroBook** | Social feed surface with in-app communication tools |

### Getting Started (Player)

OmniCore runs in your browser and installs as a PWA. No account required for most features.

1. Navigate to the hosted site (see below when live)
2. For HOTAS config: place your Star Citizen XML profile in the expected folder, then open HC05 → Technology Config
3. Right-click any binding row in HC05 to capture a new keyboard, mouse, or HOTAS input
4. Use the Ship Database to research vessels, filter by role, manufacturer, or size, and view pledge/aUEC pricing

### Hosted Access

- **Dev site**: `omnicore.evolvewp.dev` *(when live)*
- **Domain target**: `omnicore.space` *(future)*

### Local Development

#### 1) Install

```bash
npm install
```

#### 2) Run Frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Vite app: `http://localhost:4342`

### Build & Quality Commands

```bash
npm run build          # production frontend build
npm run check:bundle   # bundle budget check
npm run build:guard    # build + bundle budget (fails if over budget)
npm run lint           # eslint
npm run preview        # preview production build locally
```

### Implementation Notes

- Ship data (video mappings, role normalization, pricing) is curated to fill gaps in the upstream RSI API
- HOTAS XML writing uses a device-aware upsert — assigning a keyboard key won't clobber an existing HOTAS rebind for the same action
- Bundle is split into manual Vite chunks: `mantine`, `arwes`, `query-vendor`, `vendor`
- Security: Helmet headers, CORS allowlist, per-route rate limiting, input token validation on all HOTAS write endpoints
